And to say move is not technically right, quantum teleportation **destroys** the quantum state at one place and **recreate** that same state in a different place, moving data from one qubit to another qubit by consuming one Bell pair. This does **NOT** violate the faster-than-light communication which we will see why in a bit.\n",

She can do so by applying Bell measurement, the Bell state analyzer we used earlier, to her data qubit and her half of the Bell pair she has with Bob. After she has done the measurement, she needs to send the measurement results to Bob via some means. Once Bob receives the message from Alice saying that she already performed her part of the task, Bob can use the information and apply an operation (Pauli correction or correction frame) to his half of the destroyed Bell pair and the state which Alice held earlier will appear in Bob's qubit.
